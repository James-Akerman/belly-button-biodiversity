# Belly Button Biodiversity

This dashboard explores the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which cataloges the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dashboard is able to show the test subject demographic information, the top 10 kinds of microbes found in a test subject's belly button, how frequently the test subject washes their belly button per week, as well as the amount of each microbe found in a test subject's belly button.
